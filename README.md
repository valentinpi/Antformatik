# Antformatik

## Requirements

[AntMe 1.7.3](http://wiki.antme.net/en/Lesson1)

Maybe a way of compiling C# code yourself, if you want to make a build of your own.
Replace the AntMe.Simulation.dll in the AntMe directory with the AntMe.Simulation Balanced (so completely unfair).dll (of course you have to rename it afterwards).
You may use the dll with a colony of your own. Remember that 3 is now an accepted value for the members of the Caste attribute.
Alternatively you could use the AntMe.Player.Antformatik.dll we shipped with this build or compile it yourself.
